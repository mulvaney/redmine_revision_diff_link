# redmine_revision_diff_link

A very simple Redmine plugin to show a 'diff' link next to revisions
on the issue page.  This lets you click to the diff link directly
without having to go into the revision first and then click diff.

Not particularly useful, just a simple plugin to see how difficult it
is to get a Redmine plugin going.

# Usage

Just clone into the plugins directory in your Redmine install and
restart Redmine.
